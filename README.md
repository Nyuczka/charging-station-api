# charging-station-api
Small API for recieving data about Electrical Vehicle Charging Stations. 

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish this project in time. Here are the TO-DO's, which will be added later this week. :( 


## TO-DO: 
1. Add caching.
2. Add Dockerfile.
3. Add authorization (for now the basic one is used).
4. Add unit tests.
